            <p>Godot didn’t just ruin my game. It ruined how I think about performance and abstraction. What started as a simple voxel prototype spiraled into an existential crisis</p>
<p>It was a sunny day (probably), a few months back. I was in a hotel room on my laptop – the one I definitely bought for studying – playing Factorio, like any good student does.
And then I had a brilliant idea.
An automation game.
Factorio, but bigger! And better!</p>
<p>Did it matter that I had no experience making games?
Don't be ridiculous, of course not!</p>
<p>The plan: mix Factorio’s automation, Terraria’s boss fights, and a Minecraft-esque voxel world.
So I said, considering I have no graphics development experience I should start simple – and make a voxel engine</p>
<h2>The Prototype</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>All good games need a prototype<br />
- Sun Tzu</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Naturally, the next step was to pick an engine.<br />
I wanted something fast, simple, cross-platform – and preferably not Unity, because, well, Unity.</p>
<p>Godot seemed perfect. Lightweight, open source, recently got a shiny new 3D renderer (and also because UE hates MacOS)</p>
<p>Of course, I knew GDScript wasn't going to survive a voxel world. So I wrote the simulation in Rust and used Godot purely for visuals.<br />
Simple plan, what could possibly go wrong?</p>
<p>So I started.<br />
Made a Rust extension. Drew a quad. Then a cube. Then a whole chunk.<br />
Suddenly I had mining. Machines. Inserters. Belts. Quarries. Crafting.</p>
<p>I was unstoppable running purely on caffeine and motivation.<br />
It might sound like I'm glossing over the implementation, but the entire prototype took literally two days.</p>
<p><img src="assets/prototype.png" alt="An image of the prototype" /></p>
<p>I had so many conversations about how the quarry should work with my friends. It was an interesting design problem: finding upgrades for quarries that weren't just &quot;the same thing, but faster&quot;, especially since the quarries were meant to dig into the world and destroy it.</p>
<p>That also turned quarries into a single-pipe problem — where common resources clog the system and starve rarer ones. Totally irrelevant for this prototype though, since items were just physics bodies moving on top of belts.</p>
<p>Anyways, I was ready. I had spent roughly 32 hours over 2 days working on the first prototype of my life. I went outside to grab some food, came back, and even arranged a play-test for the next day.</p>
<p>Everything was perfect.<br />
The engine worked. The game ran smoothly – until it didn't.</p>
<h3>Things go VERY WRONG</h3>
<p>Look, I'm lucky enough to have a great computer. During my testing I couldn't even get the game to go below 144FPS.<br />
But see, I never tried throwing more quarries at it because I assumed any slow-down would come from the naturally expensive thing – the rigidbodies that I used for items.</p>
<p>In order for this to make sense I need to show you how procedurally generating a chunk goes in Godot.</p>
<p>A chunk is just a mesh made of triangles made of vertices.
In the simplest voxel engines, you’d generate a quad for every block face — slow, but simple.
For the prototype, I added a very naive culling algorithm so it wouldn’t generate hidden faces.</p>
<p>So far so good. This entire algorithm was implemented in Rust (<em>blazing fast!</em>).</p>
<p>Godot exposes a type called <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_surfacetool.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SurfaceTool</a>, which isn't technically the lowest-level API they provide but it is pretty much a drop-in replacement for pushing individual vertices into a list.</p>
<p>Anyway, here’s how that looked in code – calling into Godot from Rust, in order to draw a quad:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">fn draw_quad(st: &amp;mut SurfaceTool, k: &amp;mut i32, quad: Quad) {
    let normal = match quad.direction {
        ...
    };

    st.set_color(quad.color);
    st.set_normal(normal);
    for corner in quad.corners {
        st.add_vertex(corner);
    }


    st.add_index(*k);
    st.add_index(*k + 1);
    st.add_index(*k + 2);
    st.add_index(*k + 2);
    st.add_index(*k + 3);
    st.add_index(*k);

    *k += 4;
}
</code></pre>
<p>And here’s what “just pushing to a list” looks like in comparison:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">fn draw_quad(vertices: &amp;mut Vec&lt;Vector3&gt;, indices: &amp;mut Vec&lt;i32&gt;, k: &amp;mut i32, quad: Quad) {
    let normal = match quad.direction {
        ...
    };

    for corner in quad.corners {
        vertices.push(corner);
    }


    indices.push(*k);
    indices.push(*k + 1);
    indices.push(*k + 2);
    indices.push(*k + 2);
    indices.push(*k + 3);
    indices.push(*k);

    *k += 4;
}
</code></pre>
<p>You might notice there’s not much difference, so really, how bad could <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_surfacetool.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SurfaceTool</a> be?</p>
<p>8 milliseconds per chunk! Not terrible – until you realize doing it manually takes 300 microseconds. Twenty-seven times faster.</p>
<p>And that’s not even counting Godot’s mesh conversion time, which I’m pretty sure happens way later.</p>
<p>At this point you can probably guess what went wrong.
When my friend play-tested the game, the framerate dropped to a cinematic 10 FPS within an hour.</p>
<p>Why didn't I notice it during my own testing?
Simple, I was doing things efficiently. I already knew what to build, nothing went to waste.<br />
He, on the other hand, decided to cover the planet in quarries (like, five quarries).</p>
<p>After it dropped to 10 FPS, he stopped playing. Which, fair.<br />
I still count an hour-long playtest as a win – but the reason he stopped playing was... traumatizing.</p>
<h1>The Rebound</h1>
<p>The prototype was a success, somewhat.<br />
So now it was time to make the actual game, properly this time.</p>
<p>After that Godot fiasco I decided I'd just go pure Rust.</p>
<p>But you can't just start a project, you need an engine!
And it needs to be super performant because I never want to see someone stop playing because of performance again.</p>
<p>Okay, calm down champ.</p>
<p>After the Godot incident (yes, I'm going to call it that, fight me) I over-corrected hard in the other direction to the point where I was seriously considering making a full-blown game engine.<br />
Which, granted, isn't entirely out of the question for me... but still, absurdly unnecessary.</p>
<p>Eventually, a brick hit my head and I realized I could just... make a game.
No engine. No framework. Just raw OpenGL and a giant while loop.</p>
<p>Of course you don't need fancy frameworks or giant game engines... You can just make a game.</p>
<p>At the time, however, this was a big revelation for me.</p>
<p>So I opened up LearnOpenGL and started replicating my Godot voxel engine one-to-one. Which was quite easy, considering I had to do everything manually anyway.<br />
I had a pretty good voxel engine by this point, it was so much faster than Godot could've ever been, but now I had to actually implement game features.</p>
<p>The first of many being machines.</p>
<p>You see in games like Factorio many machines don't need to always run. In fact, they don't! Most machines take in some sort of input, process it for N frames, and then do something as a result of it.<br />
This sort of system lands itself very well to a WorkQueue.</p>
<p>Basically, whenever a machine needed to do something again in 20 ticks it would tell the WorkQueue &quot;hmu in 20 ticks&quot; and then the WorkQueue would handle that accordingly.<br />
This system made sure that even if you had millions of machines only the ones that needed to be updated this tick would be accessed.</p>
<p>Then, came the belts. In Godot I used physics bodies for items on belts because that was the easiest way to do so but it came with a lot of cons the biggest of which being the fact that belts had no throughput limit. Which cuts out basically 80% of the puzzle in automation games.</p>
<p>The tricky part about Factorio-style belts is that they need to be updated back to front, so I had to figure out which belts depend on which other belts – a mini dependency graph!<br />
Now, after coming from Godot my perception of performance was so ruined that I was incredibly worried that this was going to be a major performance bottleneck if I didn't aggressively cache it.</p>
<p>Luckily for me, I am not skilled enough to be able to write an algorithm that's able to heavily cache it so I decided to settle for just reconstructing the entire graph every frame. And guess what? It never became a performance problem.</p>
<p>Well that was simple enough, I'll also mention the things that happened after all of that.<br />
I went on a 3 week journey to optimize the heck out of the voxel engine, during which I switched from OpenGL to WGPU because OpenGL on MacOS does not support Shader Storage Buffer Objects (SSBOs)</p>
<p>I might make a post on how I optimized the voxel engine (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40JzyaOYJeY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">check out this video by Vercidium</a>) but by the end of it I had a voxel engine with async chunk &amp; mesh generation, running at 144FPS+ on an M2 MacBook using 3 GB of ram with a render distance of 3072 blocks in every direction.</p>
<p><img src="assets/voxel-engine.png" alt="Voxel Engine Picture" /></p>
<h1>The conclusion?</h1>
<p>I can't say this story has a very good conclusion because the game never ended up getting finished. Mostly because I couldn't figure out a way to make a factory game feel nice to play in a 3D voxel sandbox.</p>
<p>What I learned from all this wasn’t really about Godot or performance – it was about trust. Or the lack of it.</p>
<p>I thought I was writing about slow code, but looking back, I was really writing about black boxes I couldn’t see inside.</p>
<p>After going cold-turkey on abstractions, I realized something worse than inefficiency: bloat. It turns out working in a simple, honest codebase – one where you see everything – is just more fun.</p>
<p>For those who may want to check out the source code for the final version of the game <a href="https://github.com/todaymare/factory-game" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here you go</a></p>
<p>Maybe there's a conclusion to draw from this story, in any case I hope you enjoyed it. And if you did, consider <a href="https://ko-fi.com/todaymare" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">buying me a cup of coffee</a></p>
